  abstract = {The locomotor controller for walking, running, swimming, and flying
	animals is based on a Central Pattern Generator (CPG). Models of
	CPGs as systems of coupled non-linear oscillators have been proposed
	and have been used for the control of robots. In this paper we describe
	the implementation of an adaptive CPG model in a compact, custom
	analog VLSI circuit. We demonstrate the function of the chip by controlling
	an underactuated, running robotic leg. This circuit has adaptive
	properties that allow it to tune its behavior based on sensory feedback.
	To our knowledge this is the first instance of an adaptive CPG chip.
	This approach supports the construction of extremely inexpensive,
	low power and compact controllers for walking, flying and swimming
	machines.},
